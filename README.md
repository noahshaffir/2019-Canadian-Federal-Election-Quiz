# 2019CanadianFederalElectionQuiz
My friend and I love politics, so we decided to make a political quiz for a project in Spring 2021. We asked questions to help recommend users a party to support in the 2019 federal election in Canada, based on their political views. We did the quiz with Google forms because it connects really easily with Google Sheets. Once we were able to work with the data in Google Sheets, we used conditional formatting to help organize the data and recommend different parties based on different aspects of users' political views. Even though we made this a year and a half after the 2019 election, we still thought it was a fun thing to do. Some of the conditional formatting gets messed up when the Sheets file was exported to an Excel file, so a link to view the Sheets file has been included if it's helpful.
